# Mine_Detection_SONAR
This project demonstrates a machine learning model trained to classify sonar signals as either a mine or a rock, based on data collected from sonar returns bouncing off underwater objects. The dataset consists of 60 sonar signal attributes per sample, and the model aims to support underwater object classification for naval or research purposes.
